<para>the topological seeding constraint its use and implementation is based on the <simplesect kind="see"><para>ComboIterator. This class reimplements only the overlaps method. The meaning of the overlaps method is though slightly twisted here. In ComboIterator the combinations comming from the overlapping RoIs (the same RoI in most of the cases) are avoided. In here the the overlap is overloaded to: a) skip combinations from the same RoI (overlapping in the usual sense) b) skip combination which never formed topological combination.</para></simplesect>
In case complex structures of TEs (i.e. the topological overlap between sets of seeding TEs is qualifying a TE as matching one) </para>    </detaileddescription>
